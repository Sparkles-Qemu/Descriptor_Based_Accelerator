# qemu_system_integration
This baseline project is the starting point that you can use for the tutorial. Please use Vscode for this because it'll simplify development significantly. Stick to remote.coe.neu.edu too to prevent COE from issuing an unecessary ban hamemr. Make file allows building/ running the simulation with make and make run. A lot of comments were added to the base project to explain some of SystemC's idiosyncrasys. Tutorial can be found here: http://www.asic-world.com/systemc/tutorial.html. 
Please do not commit changes on main branch. Either develop locally or push to your own git branch. 

Good luck guys!
